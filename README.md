# Submission Reminder App

The **Submission Reminder App** is a lightweight, shell-based automation tool built to help educators and teaching assistants track students with pending assignment submissions. Designed to run in Unix/Linux environments, the app dynamically sets up a self-contained directory structure and provides runtime functionality for monitoring submissions and updating assignment information.

---

## Project Objective

- Automate the environment setup for a submission tracking app.
- Allow dynamic updating of assignment names via user input.
- Display reminders for students who have **not submitted** the current assignment.
- Practice Linux shell scripting fundamentals and real-world app organization.

---

## Project Structure (Generated by Script)

Once initialized using `create_environment.sh`, the app creates the following structure:

```

submission\_reminder\_<YourName>/
├── config/
│   └── config.env
├── data/
│   └── submissions.txt
├── scripts/
│   ├── functions.sh
│   ├── reminder.sh
│   └── startup.sh

````

Each file serves a specific purpose:
- `config.env`: Stores the current assignment name.
- `submissions.txt`: List of students and their submission status.
- `functions.sh`: Core logic to check and display pending submissions.
- `reminder.sh`: Placeholder for reminder-related logic.
- `startup.sh`: Initializes the app with current configuration and checks pending submissions.

---

## How to Use the App

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rhoda-n1cole/submission_reminder_App_rhoda-n1cole.git
cd submission_reminder_App_rhoda-n1cole
````

---

### 2. Run the Setup Script

```bash
bash create_environment.sh
```

This will:

* Ask for your name
* Create a folder `submission_reminder_<YourName>`
* Generate necessary subdirectories and populate them with required scripts and data

---

### 3. Launch the Reminder App

```bash
bash submission_reminder_<YourName>/scripts/startup.sh
```

This runs the reminder check and displays all students who haven’t submitted the current assignment.

---

### 4. Update the Assignment Name

```bash
bash copilot_shell_script.sh
```

This script prompts you for a new assignment name, updates `config.env`, and automatically re-runs the app.

---

## Sample Student Records

By default, the app includes the following test records in `submissions.txt`:

```
Aline Uwase,Submitted
Eric Nshimiyimana,Not Submitted
Jean Bosco Mugisha,Not Submitted
Clarisse Ingabire,Submitted
Patrick Habimana,Not Submitted
Diane Uwera,Submitted
Emmanuel Niyonzima,Not Submitted
```

## Features

* Fully automated app directory creation
* Modular shell scripting (separated config, logic, and data)
* Configurable assignment title via user input
* Output that clearly identifies students needing reminders
* Executable shell scripts with appropriate permissions

---

## Git Workflow

* **`feature/setup`**: All development and rough work (includes initial files and tests).
* **`main`**: Finalized version that only contains:

  * `create_environment.sh`
  * `copilot_shell_script.sh`
  * `README.md`

Merge carefully and clean up extra files.
